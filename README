Overview
========

packsiz is a tiny, lightweight, hackable and permissively-licensed package
manager for Linux (https://www.kernel.org/) distributions.

packsiz is a re-implementation of packlim (https://github.com/dimkr/packlim) in
szl (https://github.com/dimkr/szl) rather than Tcl
(https://github.com/msteveb/jimtcl/).

In addition, packsiz:
  - Supports installation of packages to a prefix other than /
  - Has a scripting interface

Scripting Interface
===================

packsiz allows complex package management tasks through an interactive scripting
shell or scripts, using a szl API in the "packsiz" namespace.

For example:

  1) To list the packages available in a repository:
    $packsiz.available http://repository {}

  2) To remove a package:
    $packsiz.remove ca-certificates [$packsiz.installed]

  3) To remove all unneeded dependency packages:
    $packsiz.cleanup

packsiz uses all API internally as well; see its implementation for more usage
examples.

Missing Features
================

  - Support for multiple repositories - packsiz is designed for small
    distributions with one repository per architecture
  - Support for multiple architectures in one repository

Building
========

  # git clone --recursive https://github.com/dimkr/packsiz
  # cd packsiz
  # meson build
  # cd build
